Financial Recommendation Expert System Using Forward Chaining (Python TUI)

Project Description:
This project implements a text-based expert system that provides financial investment recommendations based on a user’s financial profile.
The system applies a rule-based approach with forward chaining to infer suitable financial options from user-provided facts.

The program interacts with users through a command-line interface (TUI) and evaluates their income level, risk tolerance, and savings capacity to produce a recommendation.
